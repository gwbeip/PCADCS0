This is a multi-cycle RISC-V processor. It is part of the [PCADC](https://github.com/gwbeip/PCADC) project.


# Features of PCADC-S0

The main features are listed below:
- multi-cycle processor
- RV64-I ISA, machime mode only
- timmer interrupt
- support [RT-Thread](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread) operating system
- it is used for verifing the understanding of the RISC-V ISA. So, in the design time, the efficiency or clock frequency is not seriously considered.
